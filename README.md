# HotGato SpeedReader
Speed Reader for ADHD for rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP)

The speed reader is designed to assist users in rapidly reading and comprehending textual content. By breaking text down into manageable chunks and displaying them sequentially at a controlled speed, users can focus on comprehension without the distraction of scanning across lines or pages.

### Key Functionality and Features:

1. **Chunk Display:**
   * The text is divided into "chunks" of a specified number of words, and each chunk is displayed one at a time, allowing readers to absorb small bits of information rapidly.

2. **Customizable Speed:**
   * Users can set their reading speed in Words Per Minute (WPM), ranging from 100 to 1500. This allows for flexibility for both novice readers who want to start slow and speed-reading experts who want to push their limits.

3. **Customizable Chunk Size:**
   * Users have the ability to determine how many words they see in each chunk (between 1 and 5). This allows users to tailor the experience to their comfort level and reading capability.

4. **Special Punctuation Handling:**
   * The application intelligently recognizes sentence-ending punctuation and certain special characters, ensuring that they don't disrupt the reading flow. For example, "$3.99" or ".9" are treated as single entities rather than being split inappropriately.

5. **Adjustable Font Size and Family:**
   * Users can adjust the font size for better visibility, and can also choose from a variety of font families, including a special "ADHD" font where the first two letters of each word are highlighted for enhanced focus.

6. **Pause and Resume:**
   * With a simple click, users can pause their reading session and then resume it whenever they're ready.

7. **Local Storage Integration:**
   * User preferences, such as chosen speed, chunk size, font size, and font family, are saved locally. This ensures that users donâ€™t have to reset their preferences each time they use the tool.

8. **Smart Text Parsing:**
   * The tool has been designed to handle various scenarios like multiple spaces, paragraphs, URLs, etc., ensuring that users get a smooth reading experience regardless of the text's structure.

9. **Sentence Awareness:**
   * The application is smart enough to recognize when a chunk would split a sentence in a way that disrupts comprehension, adjusting the chunk to preserve the sentence's integrity.

### Appeal to Users:

Given the rise in information consumption, tools like this speed reader become essential for many who are looking to consume vast amounts of text in shorter periods. The combination of user customization and smart text handling ensures an optimal and flexible reading experience. Whether someone is studying for an exam, going through a report, or just reading for leisure, this tool can enhance their efficiency and comprehension.
